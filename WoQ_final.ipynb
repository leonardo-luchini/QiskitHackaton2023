    "The first approach it was to create a GHZ state applying a hadamard gate on the first qubit and entangling afterwise the others one by one, resulting in a O(N) evolution regarding the number of qubits. Our solution is based on paralelization of the entanglement process taking into consideration the architecture of the given quantum chip and the quality of the interqubit connections. We defined the quantum circuit as a graph and optimized it to minimize the circuit depth."
